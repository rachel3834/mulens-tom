# mulens-tom

This package is a simple example of a Target and Observation Manager (TOM) system for an astronomical observing project.  It is designed to store all information relevant to the targets selected by the users for further observation, enable the user to add new targets and observations and to view the status of the existing observation requests.  
The software is full integrated with the Las Cumbres Observatory network, providing users with a greater control over the observations they request, and enabling them to directly submit those requests to the network.  It is designed around the premise that the project is run by a team of geographically distributed people and hence the most convenient form of interface to the TOM's database is a web-based front-end.  

This example is based around the needs of a project to obtain photometric follow-up of ongoing microlensing events, but the implementation is sufficiently general that it could be easily adapted to other projects.
