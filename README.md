This package is a simple example of a Target and Observation Manager system for an astronomical observing project.  It is designed to store all information relevant to the targets selected by the users for further observation, enable the user to add new targets and observations and to view the status of the existing observation requests.  
The software is full integrated with the Las Cumbres Observatory network, providing users with a greater control over the observations they request, and enabling them to directly submit those requests to the network.
